        <h3>About Moto Payments</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>What's the purpose of Moto Payments?</summary>
            <p>Moto's success is due to its contributors. People who take time out of their day to fix a bug, or add a new feature, so that everyone can benefit.</p>
            <p>Because contributors are so important, we think they should also receive a share of the donations that Moto receives.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How does it work?</summary>
            <p>
                All the money we receive in donations is managed by OpenCollective. They keep the money safe for us, and deal with the necessary taxes and paperwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                This money can only be extracted using expenses, so that OpenCollective (and the tax man) knows exactly who has received the money.
            </p>
            <p>
                that's why you, as a Moto contributor also has to raise an expense to want some of that sweet dough
            </p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How do I, as a contributor, claim my money?</summary>
            <p>
                As explained above, we distribute the money through expenses.
            </p>
            <p>That means that you need to do three things:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create an OpenCollective account</li>
                    <li>Let us know your OpenCollective username</li>
                    <li>Create an expense</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will then approve the expense, and OpenCollective will send you the money.
            </p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Why do we need to know your OpenCollective username?</summary>
            <p>Security - just to make sure that we're paying the right person!</p>
