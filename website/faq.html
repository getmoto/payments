        <h3>About Moto Payments</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>What's the purpose of Moto Payments?</summary>
            <p>Moto's success is all due to its contributors. People who take time out of their day to fix a bug, or add a new feature, so that everyone can benefit.</p>
            <p>Because contributors are so important, we think they should also receive a share of the donations that Moto receives.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How does it work?</summary>
            <p>All the donations we receive are managed by OpenCollective. In order for anyone to receive money, they have to create an expense.</p>
            <p>That's why we invite select Moto contributors to create expense, in order to receive some of the donation money.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How do I, as a contributor, claim my money?</summary>
            <p>
                If the Payments-page shows that you are eligible to receive money, you need to do three things:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create an OpenCollective account</li>
                    <li>Let us know your OpenCollective username</li>
                    <li>Create an expense against <a href="https://opencollective.com/moto">https://opencollective.com/moto</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will then approve the expense and send you the money.
            </p>
        </details>
